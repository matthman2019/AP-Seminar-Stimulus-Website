    <h1>Source Summary</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>The source explains why we get nostalgia, and how it can affect our perception of the past, and how we feel about events happening in the present and future. </li>
        <li>It shows that there never were "The Good Ol' Days," and any attempt to return to them is futile. It argues should be careful of parents, politicians, and populists who want to return to the past.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Overall Argument</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>This source argues how nostalgia can be selective and alter one's decisions causing people to only remember the good memories leading to idealization of the past causing us to ignore the advancements and benefits of modern life.</li>
        <li>"Nostalgia is a necessary human trait, but it's not a governing philosophy" (Norberg 6).</li>
    </ul>
